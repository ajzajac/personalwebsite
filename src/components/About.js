                    <p >I'm Andrew a Software Engineer that's fluent in JavaScript, Ruby on Rails and React.</p>
                    <p >My approach to solving a problem is best described as testing solutions on paper the old fashioned way, then translating it into code. 
                    Developing and contributing to innovative ideas, driving towards excellence and putting my stamp on something that can affect change is where I thrive. Working as part of a team is one of my greatest strengths, however I am not afraid to tackle problems on my own. </p>
                    <p style={{marginBottom: '-1%', paddingBottom: '2%'}}>I live in New York City and enjoy every busy day traversing the city and continuing to find new hidden gem restaurants. In my spare time when I'm not coding you can find me playing Overwatch or any RTS released before 2005. I am always looking for people to collaborate with, learn from, or help in their own coding journey, never be afraid to reach out! </p>
